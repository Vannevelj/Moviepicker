Moviepicker
===========

This app will suggest movies for you to watch. It takes into account your history to determine what movie you might like based on certain metrics. 

General concept mockups:

The project in its current state consists of a backend (ASP.NET Web Api 2) and frontend (Android). The API will be hosted on azure.

## Dependencies

### Backend

* ASP.NET Web API 2
* Json.NET
* AutoMapper
* Entity-Framework
* MsTest
* Effort
* NMemory
* Unity
* MvcRouteTester

### Android

## TODO

Right now the small existing codebase will be rewritten. However before that happens, I'll first create a system that downloads all relevant data into a database and create my own slimmed down wrapper around the API.
