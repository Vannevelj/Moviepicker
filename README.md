Moviepicker
===========

This app will suggest movies for you to watch. It takes into account your history to determine what movie you might like based on certain metrics. 

General concept mockups:

### How far along is the project?

At the time of writing, I'm deciding on the exact approach of how I determine the metrics. Once that is done I will implement the rest of the REST Api interface after which a proof of concept of the Android app will be started. You can follow the exact progress through the YouTRACK issue tracker. If you would like access, send me an email at `jer_vannevel<at>outlook.com`.

### How do I contribute?

I am not actively looking for help but I will review every code you send in. Do note that I would like to do the initial work on the Android app and as such I will be hesitant with pull requests towards this aspect. If you want to improve another aspect of the code, shoot me an email or open a pull request so we can discuss some specifics.
